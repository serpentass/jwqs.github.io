    <div class="about">
        <p>A natural moat called the Luo river split the great land into two. Jing of the north, and Wei of the south. One was the Prince of the grass plains who had no worries or sorrow. One was a lawful Princess who received exclusive favour of the Emperor. <br>
A war turned the Prince of the grass plains into an orphan. She who had laid dormant for ten years had originally planned to become a sycophantic official, to manipulate the enemy kingdom into chaos, but she was appointed as Fuma at the Chionglin banquet.
<br>Wait and see, how this debt of grudge from a fallen kingdom and devastated home will be settled.</p>

        <p class="text">    Qiyan Agula (乞颜•阿古拉, Qǐyán Āgǔlā), also known as Qi Yan (齐颜, Qí Yán), is the Prince of the Grass Plains and one of the main characters of Jing Wei Qing Shang.

      After being orphaned during the Wei invasion of the Grass Plains, Agula swore to get revenge for the slaughter of her family and the destruction of her homeland. She disguised herself as a frail scholar named Qi Yan to become an official within the Wei court and destroy the kingdom from within. Yet despite all her scheming, she was appointed Fuma to Nangong Rang's daughter, Nangong Jingnu. </p>

        <p class="text">    Nangong Jingnu (南宫静女, Nángōng Jìngnǚ) is the youngest and only legitimate princess of the Nangong family and Wei Kingdom. She is one of the main characters in Jing Wei Qing Shang. 
      Nangong Jingnu goes through a very important growth in terms of personality in the story. At the beginning she acts naive, spoiled, entitled and she doesn't care about politics as she's the only legitimate daughter of the emperor and her status is never challenged. </p>
